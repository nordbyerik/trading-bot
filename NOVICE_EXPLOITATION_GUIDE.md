## 1. Event Volatility Crush

### Concept
Similar to IV (Implied Volatility) crush in options trading, prediction market prices spike before major events then normalize afterward. Novice traders FOMO into high-volatility positions without understanding this pattern.

### What Novices Do Wrong
- Buy into price spikes driven by breaking news
- Extrapolate short-term momentum indefinitely
- Chase moves without considering mean reversion
- Use market orders during high volatility
- Don't wait for prices to stabilize

### How We Exploit It

**Detection Signals:**
- 15-20%+ price move in 24-48 hours
- 2-3x volume spike (FOMO activity)
- Move followed by stagnation (momentum exhausted)

**Trading Strategy:**
- **Fade the move**: Take opposite side when spike stagnates
- **Wait for normalization**: Provide liquidity after initial panic
- **Avoid the top**: Never chase into the spike itself

**Example:**
```
Market: "Team wins championship"
- Breaking news: Star player injury
- Price crashes 35¢ → 15¢ in 6 hours (3x volume)
- Next 12 hours: hovers 13-16¢ (stagnated)
- OPPORTUNITY: Price likely overshot, expect partial reversion to 20-25¢
```

### Configuration
```yaml
event_volatility:
  hard_min_price_change_pct: 20.0  # 20% move = strong signal
  hard_min_volume_spike: 3.0       # 3x volume = FOMO confirmed
  hard_hours_lookback: 24          # Recent move
```

---

## 2. Enhanced Theta Decay

### Concept
In options, theta is time decay. In prediction markets, prices should converge toward 0 or 1 as expiration approaches. Novices hold uncertain positions (30-70¢) too close to expiration.

### What Novices Do Wrong
- Don't understand exponential decay in final hours
- Hold 50¢ positions with 6 hours left (maximum uncertainty)
- Panic sell in final hours at terrible prices
- Buy "lottery tickets" in last hours without proper odds calculation
- Don't price weekend/overnight gap risk

### How We Exploit It

**New Features:**
- **Panic Zone Detection**: Final 6 hours where novices make worst decisions
- **Dead Cat Bounce**: Irrational spikes against convergence trend
- **Exponential Urgency**: Edge multipliers increase in final hours

**Exploit Scenarios:**

1. **Panic Zone Exploitation** (< 6 hours to expiration):
   - Market at 45¢ with 4 hours left
   - Should be converging, but stuck at uncertainty
   - Novices will panic soon → take informed side

2. **Dead Cat Bounce**:
   - Market trending to 0 (now 8¢, 5 hours left)
   - Sudden spike to 15¢ on late-breaking "hope"
   - FADE: Likely overshoots, will collapse to 0-5¢

3. **Inverse Dead Cat** (The "Sure Thing Trap"):
   - Market at 94¢, 3 hours left
   - Novices won't sell because "want the full dollar"
   - Can buy at 93-94¢ with near-certain 6-7¢ edge

**Example:**
```
Market: "Bill passes by Friday 5pm"
Thursday 11am: 48¢ (still uncertain)
  - Normal: Should start converging
  - Reality: Still at 48¢ = novice indecision

Friday 11am: 52¢ (6 hours left, IN PANIC ZONE)
  - OPPORTUNITY: Take informed directional bet
  - Novices will panic in next 2-4 hours
  - Edge multiplier: 2x in panic zone
```

### Configuration
```yaml
theta_decay:
  panic_zone_hours: 6.0            # When novices panic
  panic_multiplier: 2.0            # Double our edge estimate
  dead_cat_bounce_threshold: 0.10  # 10%+ spike against trend
```

---

## 3. Recency Bias

### Concept
Novices overweight recent information and underweight base rates. They extrapolate short-term trends and ignore historical context.

### What Novices Do Wrong
- See 2-day uptrend, assume it continues forever
- Ignore that price was different just 3 days ago
- React to each news item like it's the most important ever
- Don't calculate fair value from historical average
- Forget about mean reversion

### How We Exploit It

**Detection Method:**
- Calculate historical mean (exclude recent window)
- Identify sharp deviation from mean
- Confirm momentum has stagnated
- Bet on partial mean reversion

**Key Metrics:**
- **Deviation**: Current price vs. 72-hour mean
- **Stagnation**: Recent 6-hour movement < 5-8%
- **Direction**: Did it spike up or drop?

**Trading Strategy:**
- Wait for stagnation confirmation (don't catch falling knives)
- Assume 40-60% reversion to mean (not full reversion)
- Scale position with deviation magnitude

**Example:**
```
Market: "Election poll prediction"
Days 1-3: Steady at 55¢ (mean = 55¢)
Day 4: New poll! Spikes to 75¢ (36% deviation)
Day 4 (6 hours later): Still at 73-76¢ (stagnated)

Analysis:
- 20¢ deviation from recent mean
- Likely overreaction to single data point
- Expected partial reversion: 50% × 20¢ = 10¢
- TRADE: Sell at 75¢, expect drop to 65-68¢
```

### Configuration
```yaml
recency_bias:
  hard_min_deviation_pct: 25.0     # 25% from mean
  hard_stagnation_threshold: 0.05  # < 5% recent movement
  lookback_hours: 72               # 3-day baseline
  recent_window_hours: 6           # Define "stagnation"
```

## 4. Psychological Levels

### Concept
Novice traders exhibit predictable behavioral biases at certain price levels. These create exploitable patterns.

### Four Types of Psychological Bias

#### A. Lottery Ticket Bias (1-5¢)

**What Novices Think:**
- "It's only 2¢, might as well buy some"
- "Cheap price = good value"
- "Small downside, huge upside!"

**Reality:**
- 2¢ = 49:1 implied odds
- Often overpriced because "cheap" nominal cost
- True fair value might be 0.5-1¢

**How to Exploit:**
- Sell lottery tickets at inflated prices
- Novices buy because nominal cost is low
- They don't calculate proper odds

**Example:**
```
Market: "Aliens land by December" at 3¢
- Implied odds: 32:1
- True odds: probably 1000:1
- TRADE: Sell at 3¢, hold to expiration
```

#### B. Sure Thing Trap (95-99¢)

**What Novices Think:**
- "I want the full dollar, won't sell at 98¢"
- "It's definitely happening, hold till expiration"
- "Those last 2¢ are mine!"

**Reality:**
- That 2¢ has massive opportunity cost
- Could deploy capital elsewhere
- Even 98% certain events have 2% risk
- Tying up $98 for $2 = poor return

**How to Exploit:**
- Buy "sure things" at 96-98¢
- Novices refuse to sell below "full value"
- Capture 2-4¢ with near-certain outcome
- Or provide early exit liquidity at premium

**Example:**
```
Market: "Sun rises tomorrow" at 97¢
- Novice: Holding 100 contracts, won't sell
- You: Buy at 97¢ (3¢ edge if resolves Yes)
- Capital efficiency: Novice ties up $97, you earn 3%
```

#### C. Round Number Clustering (25¢, 50¢, 75¢)

**What Novices Do:**
- Place limit orders at exact round numbers
- Psychological anchoring on "nice" numbers
- Create artificial support/resistance

**How to Exploit:**
- Identify when price "sticks" near round number
- Provide liquidity just inside the cluster
- Or exploit breakouts when resistance breaks

**Example:**
```
Market: Hovering at 49-51¢ for 12 hours
- Strong 50¢ anchoring
- Huge volume at exactly 50¢
- STRATEGY: Place orders at 49¢/51¢ (inside spread)
- Capture spread from indecisive novices
```

#### D. 50¢ Anchoring (Special Case)

**What Novices Think:**
- "50/50 odds = 50¢ fair price"
- "Maximum uncertainty = wait and see"
- Analysis paralysis

**Reality:**
- True fair value might be 45¢ or 55¢
- They anchor on mathematical "middle"
- Creates predictable stagnation

**How to Exploit:**
- Take informed directional position
- Provide liquidity while they're paralyzed
- Profit when price eventually resolves one way

### Configuration
```yaml
psychological_levels:
  lottery_max_price: 0.05              # Flag under 5¢
  lottery_implied_odds_threshold: 30.0 # > 30:1 odds

  sure_thing_min_price: 0.95           # Flag over 95¢
  sure_thing_opportunity_cost_cents: 2.0

  round_numbers: [0.25, 0.50, 0.75]    # Clustering points
  anchor_center: 0.50                   # Special 50¢ case
  anchor_tolerance: 0.05                # 45-55¢ range
```

## 5. Liquidity Traps

### Concept
Novices see tight bid-ask spread and think "liquid market." They don't check order book depth and get terrible fills.

### What Novices Do Wrong
- Only look at spread, ignore depth
- Use market orders without checking size
- Don't understand slippage
- Think "3¢ spread" means they'll get filled
- Don't calculate price impact of their order size

### How We Exploit It

**Detection:**
- Tight spread (< 5-8¢) = looks good
- Thin depth (< 100-200 contracts) = trap
- High price impact (> 10-15%) = terrible execution

**Exploitation Strategies:**

1. **Provide Liquidity at Premium:**
   - Novice wants to buy 100 contracts
   - Market order would walk the book (bad fill)
   - You offer 100 contracts at premium vs. market
   - Still better than their slippage

2. **Exploit Market Orders:**
   - Place limit orders deeper in book
   - Capture novice market orders
   - Get filled at favorable prices

3. **Illiquidity Premium:**
   - Charge extra for providing size
   - Novices will pay to avoid walking the book

**Example:**
```
Market: 45¢ bid / 48¢ ask (3¢ spread - looks tight!)

Order Book Depth:
- 45¢: 20 contracts
- 44¢: 15 contracts
- 43¢: 10 contracts
- 48¢: 25 contracts
- 49¢: 20 contracts
- 50¢: 15 contracts

Novice wants to buy 100 contracts with market order:
- Fills: 25 @ 48¢, 20 @ 49¢, 15 @ 50¢, 40 @ 51¢
- Average fill: 49.4¢ (not 48¢!)
- Price impact: 2.9% slippage

Our Strategy:
- Offer 100 contracts at 49¢ (limit order)
- Better than their market order execution
- We earn 1¢ premium over ask (49¢ vs. 48¢)
```

### Configuration
```yaml
liquidity_trap:
  hard_max_spread_cents: 5.0         # Deceptively tight
  hard_max_top_depth: 100            # Very thin
  hard_min_price_impact_pct: 15.0    # Significant slippage
  test_order_size: 100               # Simulate 100 contracts
  illiquidity_premium_cents: 3.0     # What we can charge
```

## 6. Strategy Combinations

### Multiple Exploits Simultaneously

Often markets exhibit multiple novice behaviors at once:

#### Example 1: Panic Zone + Psychological Level
```
Market: 48¢, 4 hours to expiration
- In panic zone (< 6 hours)
- At 50¢ anchor point
- DOUBLE EXPLOIT: Panic + anchoring bias
- Edge multiplier: 2x (panic) + psychological resistance
```

#### Example 2: Event Volatility + Recency Bias
```
Market: Breaking news spike, then stagnation
- 30% move up in 12 hours (event volatility)
- 25% above 72-hour mean (recency bias)
- Both analyzers flag it
- High confidence: Multiple confirming signals
```

#### Example 3: Liquidity Trap + Lottery Ticket
```
Market: 3¢ with tight spread but thin depth
- Lottery ticket bias (novices buying "cheap")
- Liquidity trap (they'll use market orders)
- EXPLOIT: Provide overpriced liquidity
- They pay 4¢ instead of 3¢ due to slippage
```

### Strategy Priority

When multiple opportunities exist:

1. **Highest Confidence First**
   - Arbitrage > Theta Decay > Others
   - Risk-free > High Confidence > Medium

2. **Time Sensitivity**
   - Panic zone (< 6 hours) = urgent
   - Event volatility = act quickly before reversion
   - Psychological levels = patient

3. **Capital Efficiency**
   - Sure thing trap (95¢) requires more capital
   - Lottery tickets (3¢) tie up less capital
   - Liquidity provision = market-making capital

---

## Risk Management

### Key Principles

1. **Never Chase Moves**
   - Wait for stagnation confirmation
   - Don't catch falling knives
   - Recency bias requires patience

2. **Position Sizing**
   - Theta decay near expiration = higher risk
   - Psychological levels = medium risk
   - Liquidity provision = lower risk (market-making)

3. **Time Horizon**
   - Panic zone = minutes to hours
   - Event volatility = hours to days
   - Psychological levels = days to weeks

4. **Confirmation Signals**
   - One analyzer = investigate
   - Two analyzers = strong signal
   - Three+ analyzers = highest confidence

### Avoiding Counter-Exploitation

**Don't become the novice:**
- Always check order book depth before trading
- Calculate expected fill price, not just spread
- Don't FOMO into analyzer signals
- Remember: markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
- These are edges, not guarantees

## Configuration Guide

### Aggressive Mode (More Opportunities)
Use SOFT thresholds for all analyzers:
```yaml
event_volatility:
  soft_min_price_change_pct: 15.0  # Lower bar

theta_decay:
  soft_hours_to_expiration: 48.0   # Earlier detection

recency_bias:
  soft_min_deviation_pct: 15.0     # More sensitive
```

### Conservative Mode (Higher Quality)
Use HARD thresholds only:
```yaml
event_volatility:
  hard_min_price_change_pct: 20.0  # Strict requirements
  hard_min_volume_spike: 3.0       # Clear FOMO signal

theta_decay:
  hard_hours_to_expiration: 24.0   # Closer to expiration
  panic_multiplier: 2.0            # Focus on panic zone
```

### Balanced Mode (Recommended)
Enable both HARD and SOFT, prioritize by strength:
- HARD opportunities = immediate action
- SOFT opportunities = watchlist

When running with novice exploitation config:

```
================================================================================
FOUND 5 OPPORTUNITY(IES)
================================================================================

=== MOMENTUM_FADE OPPORTUNITY [HARD] ===
Confidence: high
Time: 2025-11-06 14:23:15

Markets: ELECTION-WINNER-2024
  - Presidential election winner prediction
    https://kalshi.com/markets/ELECTION

Current Prices:
  ELECTION-WINNER-2024: 72.0¢

Estimated Edge: 12.0¢ (16.7%)

Reasoning: Detected 28.5% upward move with 3.2x volume spike. Likely novice FOMO
- potential for volatility crush and mean reversion after event/hype subsides.

Additional: Analysis Type: event_volatility_crush, Exploit: novice_overreaction_to_news

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== MISPRICING OPPORTUNITY [HARD] ===
Confidence: high
Time: 2025-11-06 14:23:16

Markets: UFO-DISCLOSURE-2024
  - Government UFO disclosure by year end
    https://kalshi.com/markets/UFO

Current Prices:
  UFO-DISCLOSURE-2024: 2.0¢

Estimated Edge: 1.0¢ (50.0%)

Reasoning: LOTTERY TICKET BIAS: Price at 2.0¢ implies 49:1 odds. Novices buying
because it's 'cheap' nominally, but likely overpriced. High volume (156) confirms
novice activity.

Additional: Bias Type: lottery_ticket, Exploit: nominal_price_illusion

## Testing and Validation

### Backtesting Approach
1. Run simulation on closed markets
2. Identify which patterns had highest success rate
3. Calibrate thresholds based on historical data
4. Test edge estimates against actual outcomes

### Paper Trading
1. Log all opportunities without real trades
2. Track hypothetical P&L
3. Identify which exploits work best in live markets
4. Refine configuration

### Live Trading (When Ready)
1. Start with smallest position sizes
2. Focus on highest confidence signals only
3. Track actual vs. estimated edge
4. Iterate and improve
